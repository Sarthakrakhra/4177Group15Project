## Authors

[Sarthak Rakhra](sarthak.rakhra@dal.ca) - Creator of the project

## Getting started

The following instructions will show you how to run a local copy of the project

### Prerequisites

To ensure the app can run on your local machine you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), and [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)

### Running the app on localhost

```
npm i
npm start
```

Open the app on http://localhost:8080 as NodeJS is serving the build file on that port. If you wish to use a development server, run `npm run development` instead of `npm start`.

## Built with

The front end of this application was built using ReactJS and Material UI. The reason ReactJS was selected as the front-end framework was because of the advantages it provides. Such as component-based development, state management, and fast rendering of the page in the browser. Material UI was selected as the design framework as it was made for the React framework and at the same time it comes responsive out of the box. Material UI is created by Google and follows their design conventions which apply most if not all design patterns.
